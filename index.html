          <p> I'm a Bootcamp Graduate with Full-stack experience. I like working with React.js to create accessible and intuitive experiences.</p>
          <p> On this website, I want to share everything I've worked on with you. </p>

        <p>The best websites are simple.<br>I think accessibility is the most important thing when designing for the web. <br> While you're here, you can read a bit about my projects. Why not click the GitHub logo by each project to see the whole process? Or perhaps play around with one of the games!  <br>
          I want to keep things simple and easy to read - I hope you like it!

      <h3>Cruise Ship</h3>
      <div class="project-inner-content">
        <img src="/images/cruise-ship.png" />
        <p>I made an interactive cruise ship where the user can create their own itinerary.<br> I learnt about test driven 
          development and DOM manipulation - I created different types of objects that could interact with eachother.
          <br> This was the first time I had to get user input data from a form - it was super challenging at first. <br>

      <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
      <div class="project-inner-content">
        <img src="/images/virtual-pet.png" />
        <p>This was my first javascript project!<br> Using test driven development, I created dynamic javascript objects with properties such as age, hunger and fitness. Next, I designed and created a user interface with a choice of 3 different pets and unique animations for each one.
          <br> To play this game, you need to feed and play with the pet to keep it alive!

      <h3>Weather App</h3>
      <div class="project-inner-content">
        <img src="/images/weather-app.png" />
        <p>This was my first project built with react!<br> This is an app that can pull weather forecast data from an API. I also added a search function that allows the user to search for the weather anywhere in the UK. <br> 
        I then designed and created a user interface that (I think) looks really pretty.

      <div class="project-inner-content">
        <img src="/images/music-library.png" />
        <p>This is a music library API built with Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. <br> This API was built using test-driven development, and the testing was done with Mocha, Chai and Supertest. <br> This was made during the back-end module at Command Shift Bootcamp, and working on this project has made me feel much more comfortable working with APIs.</p>
